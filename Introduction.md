# Introduction / Business Problem
How homogenous are the three of the largest cities in the United States in terms of venue data from Foursquare, and arrests data (except for Houston) from public police reports?

Clusters neighborhoods based on most common venue/arrest categories to examine homogeneity of cities, particularly of interest to public and planning officials to identify prominent clusters in relation to demographic data to design and allocate resources more efficiently. 

Foursquare API is used to get venue location data using the `explore` function and using basic coordinate and category data only. While, public crime data from 2019 to date is used for the arrests data (described in detail in Data.md).
