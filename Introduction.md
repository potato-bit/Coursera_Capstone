# Introduction / Business Problem
Using venue data, neighborhood demographics and crime data, which neighborhood in Chicago and New York City is the safest from property crimes to open a new venue?

Suppose, an entrepreneur wants to find out whether the location he/she is opening a new venue carries a high risk of property crime. We attempt to answer the question using machine-learning techniques to find the best location to open a new venue safe from crime. These techniques will include kMeans clustering, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms to recommend the optimal location.

Further, the results of the analysis could provide useful insights for public planning officials for neighborhood-level development and crime prevention by focusing education and other poverty-reducing resources


Venue data is gathered using the Foursquare API, neighborhood demographics are gathered from various sources from the US Census Bureau, and crime data is taken from the relevant police authority databases. The data processing and sources are described in detail in [Data.md](https://github.com/potato-bit/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Data.md)
